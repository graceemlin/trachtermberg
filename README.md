The [Trachtenberg system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachtenberg_system) is a set of techniques for rapid multiplication and other arithmetic operations developed by Jakow Trachtenberg.\
It simplifies complex calculations by breaking them down into more manageable steps.\
This game concentrates on the "two-finger" method, enabling swift mental multiplication of larger numbers.
